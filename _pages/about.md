I am a PhD student in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at NTU, Singapore. My research focus is on the interpretability of RL policies, specifically making them trustworthy. Currently, I am studying the application of decision trees in RL. I am also interested in Computer Vision and Deep Learning. Additionally, I have a strong interest in Computer Vision and Deep Learning. Before joining NTU, I completed my master's degree at ISI Kolkata and my bachelor's degree at NIT Silchar. 

<!-- **Coming Soon!**: my first [blog](/posts/2023/05/blog-post-irl/) on Interpretability of RL policies.
