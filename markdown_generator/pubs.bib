abstract="Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) policies that bind user service requests to edge servers, seldom take into account user preferences of Quality-of-Service (QoS) and the resulting Quality-of-Experience (QoE). In this paper, we design a novel user-centric optimal allocation policy considering the QoS preferences of users, with an attempt to maximize the overall QoE. Additionally, we propose a real-time mobility aware user-centric heuristic algorithm to solve the allocation problem by accommodating the time varying QoS demands of users. Experimental results on real data sets demonstrate the efficiency of our allocation scheme and a comparison with state-of-art approaches in MEC literature.",
