𝟏. 𝐒𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐟𝐲 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰: Why you are conducting the review? Most of the PhD students conduct literature review at the start of their PhD. The aim here is to identify the research gap that they can fill in their PhD. There can be other reasons for literature review too.

𝟐. 𝐃𝐞𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬: In consultation with your advisor, you will specify the broader research topic for your PhD. Then, you will specify the initial set of research questions for the literature review. Mostly the questions are of the style that what are the key challenges and solutions in a particular domain.

𝟑. 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭 𝐚 𝐩𝐢𝐥𝐨𝐭 𝐬𝐭𝐮𝐝𝐲: Once you specify the initial research questions, then you will manually identify around 10 primary studies relevant to your topic. Based on these 10 papers, check whether you can answer the initial set of questions. If not, try to modify your questions accordingly.

𝟒. 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐬𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠: Define a search string based on your research questions that can retrieve relevant papers from well-known databases such as IEEE, ACM, Google Scholar, etc. You can verify the search string by making sure that it returns the already known 10 relevant papers.

𝟓. 𝐃𝐞𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐞𝐱𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐚: The search string will return a larger number of papers. All of these will not be relevant to your literature review. So, you will define inclusion and exclusion criteria to help you guide in the selection process. You can include study quality assessment in this step.

𝟔. 𝐒𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐫𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐬𝐭𝐮𝐝𝐢𝐞𝐬: Using the inclusion and exclusion criteria, select the most suitable studies that can answer your research questions. You can do this selection based on reading paper title, paper abstract, or the whole paper.

𝟕. 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭 𝐞𝐱𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐩𝐚𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬: Once the study selection is complete, design a form that you will use for data extraction. This form determines what items you will extract from the papers. Start reading each paper and extract items as per the designed data extraction form.

𝟖. 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐳𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚: Once data is extracted from all the papers, you will analyze the data using various techniques (e.g., thematic analysis) to answer the research questions. Alongside the analysis, you can also report the data in form of a report or secondary study.
